======================
-http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/<br>
-Tutorials and learning<br>

-The most helpful resource I found for learning relational algebra for understanding the theory behind joins was the Coursera course on introduction to data science unit 2: https://class.coursera.org/datasci-002/<br>
