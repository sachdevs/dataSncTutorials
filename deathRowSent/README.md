Sentiment Analysis of Last Words of Death Row Criminals in Texas Since 1982

After the fun I had with the Twitter sentiment analysis I just had to mess around with different datasets. So, this one is (slightly morbid yet cool) taken from: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html The Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice conveniently keeps a record of this data and so I just had to give it a shot.
